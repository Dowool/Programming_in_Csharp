# Assignment 1: Hello World
Follow the .NET Core tutorial here to create a "hello world" application on your computer. Make sure you follow the instructions to install the .NET SDK locally:
- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro (Links to an external site.)
Change the "Hello, World!" statement inside of Program.cs to say "Hello, <your-name>" where <your-name> is replaced with your own name.
Take a screenshot of the output of the application and save it as "Screenshot.png".
You can use the Windows snipping tool to take a screenshot, by going to Start and searching for Snipping Tool. You can also press the "print screen" button on your keyboard (usually next to F12), and then press "paste" in an application like Microsoft Paint in order to save a screenshot.
